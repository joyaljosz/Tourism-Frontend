        <h1>PLACES TO VISIT IN KOTTAYAM</h1>
        <p>Kottayam is known for rubber and spices. Rubber trees are grown on a large and small scale by every household. Due to the large scale cultivation and marketing of rubber in Kottayam, the Government of India has set up the Rubber Board which is
            located in Kottayam. Another important plant product that is widely grown in Kottayam is vanilla. Other spices such as cardamom, cloves and star anise are important commercial spices that are grown and marketed in Kottayam. Kottayam is a small
            city and some of the important places in Kottayam include the Kottayam-Kumily road, the Sastri Road, Baker Junction and Kanjikuzhy. The major contributor to economy is tourism. Kottayam is situated very near to the famed backwater tourist
            destination of Kumarakom. The Vembanad lake also makes its presence felt and provides excellent opportunities for houseboat cruises. There is also a bird sanctuary at Kottayam which attracts hordes of tourists every year. Although there is
            presence of Hindus and Muslims in Kottayam, a majority of the population is Syrian Christian community. The food does not differ largely from the rest of Kerala, but some of the specialities of the Kottayam cuisine sets it apart from others.
